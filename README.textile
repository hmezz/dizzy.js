h1. dizzy.js

Dizzy enables you to create non-linear presentations on a single canvas, using SVG and Javascript.
There is an "online editor":http://dizzy.metafnord.org for presentation files available, although you could also host your own with the code provided here (no serverside code needed). (:

See "Browser support":http://github.com/Moerphy/dizzy.js/wiki/Browser-support in the wiki

h2. Contribute

If you want to develop for Dizzy check out the dev branch (contains everything including tools, so it may take some time). There will be some information on how to write new modules on the Wiki shortly. If you have any questions regarding development, you can message me on github or, even better, open an issue on this repository.
