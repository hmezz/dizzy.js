- ---> !!!Comment everything!!! <-----

- toFix: dialog-open.html incorrect dimensions for small-sized windows

- toFix: the zebra is not visible on selected black elements

- toAdd: text editing tools (at least color and size-up, size-down)

- toAdd: Capture View (as in Prezi.com)

- toAdd: Path Tool

- to Remember: the zebra is not visible on Gnu/Linux browser using XAMPP:
	in css
	#zebra-scale {
	url("../img/zebra-background.svg") repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
	---> Browser on Linux fail to load the url (??? mistery)

- (toFix) fixed somehow: (first start default tool problem) zebra unusable at first page load !!! it registers after being called :S
	 it is called before -> XHR finished loading: "http://localhost/dizzy.js/dev/html/zebra.html".
