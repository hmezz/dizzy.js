- to Fix: Make the zebra visible on Gnu/Linux browser:
	in css
	#zebra-scale {
	url("../img/zebra-background.svg") repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
	---> Browser on Linux fail to load the url (??? mistery)
	(it happens just on some browsers -> it's not an urgent issue)

- toFix: dialog-open.html incorrect dimensions for small-sized windows

- toFix: zebra unusable at first page load !!! it registers after being called :S
